# 🚀 Hinglish RAG Chatbot – LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation 🇮🇳  

This project is an **LLM-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** designed specifically for **Hinglish (Hindi-English code-switched) conversations**. Inspired by **TurboML’s mission to democratize AI**, this chatbot leverages **efficient retrieval** and **lightweight inference** to enable real-time, multilingual AI applications.  

## ✨ Key Features  

🔹 **FAISS-based Retrieval** – Quickly fetches relevant Hinglish text to enhance context.  
🔹 **LLM-powered Response Generation** – Uses **Mistral-7B/LLaMA-2-7B** for contextual replies.  
🔹 **Optimized for Low-Resource Languages** – Custom embeddings & reinforcement learning improve retrieval.  
🔹 **Efficient Inference Pipeline** – Runs on **GPU for fast processing** in real-world applications.  
🔹 **Gradio-powered UI** – Interactive chatbot interface for seamless deployment.  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Retrieval:** FAISS searches the most relevant Hinglish text snippets.  
2️⃣ **Contextual Prompting:** Retrieved text is formatted into a structured prompt.  
3️⃣ **Response Generation:** A fine-tuned LLM (Mistral/LLaMA-2) generates an appropriate response.  
4️⃣ **User Interaction:** The chatbot provides real-time answers in Hinglish.  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup (Run on GPU 🚀)  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LLM_Hinglish/hinglish-rag-chatbot.git  
cd hinglish-rag-chatbot  

# Install dependencies (Ensure GPU support)
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Run the chatbot
python app.py  
```

## 🖥️ Gradio Interface  

To launch the chatbot UI:  

```bash
python app.py  
```

This will generate a **public shareable link** for easy access.  

## 💡 Motivation & Impact  

✅ **India-first LLM Adaptation:** Hinglish is widely spoken but underrepresented in AI models.  
✅ **Scalable & Efficient:** Works well even in low-resource environments.  
✅ **TurboML Inspiration:** Aligns with the mission of building **open-source foundation models** for India.
